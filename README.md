Project: Data Manipulation
Author: Ibrahim Shedoh
Date: 09/09/2024
Overview
This project demonstrates data manipulation techniques in Python. It involves reading a dataset of dog information, which includes attributes such as name, breed, color, height, weight, and date of birth. The data is organized into a pandas DataFrame and displayed as a table for analysis.

Key Features
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Display: A table of dog attributes is displayed in a structured format, showcasing information such as name, breed, and physical characteristics.
Duplication Check: There are duplicate rows in the dataset, which could be handled in further steps for analysis or cleaning.
Data Sample
The dataset includes the following columns:

Name: Dog's name (e.g., Max, Bella).
Breed: Breed of the dog (e.g., Labrador, Poodle).
Color: Color of the dog (e.g., Black, White).
Height: Height of the dog in centimeters.
Weight: Weight of the dog in kilograms.
Date of Birth: The dog's birthdate.
Sample Data Preview
Index	Name	Breed	Color	Height (cm)	Weight (kg)	Date of Birth
0	Max	Labrador	Black	60	30	2018-06-20
1	Bella	Poodle	White	40	20	2019-03-14
2	Charlie	Beagle	Brown	35	18	2017-09-25
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas library
How to Run
Ensure that Python and pandas are installed on your machine.
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Run the script to display the data in a table format.
Future Enhancements
Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates or handling missing data.
Data Analysis: Adding analysis functions to find trends or insights from the dataset.
Visualization: Incorporating graphs to visualize relationships within the data.
